### How to Use the README:

1. **Replace Placeholder Text:**
   - Replace `<your-username>` and `<your-repo>` with your GitHub username and repository name, respectively.
   - Update `[Your Name](https://github.com/<your-username>)` with your name and GitHub profile link if desired.

2. **Create a License File (Optional):**
   - If you include a `LICENSE` file, you can specify the type of license (e.g., MIT License).

3. **Add the README to Your Repository:**
   - Save the file as `README.md` in your repository’s root directory.

Feel free to adjust the README to better fit your project’s needs! Let me know if you need any more help.
